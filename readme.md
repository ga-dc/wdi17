## Tips

- <code>&grave;hello&grave;</code>: Backtics (the top-left of the keyboard on a Mac) makes text show up in a monospace font. Great for code.
- Code blocks are made with three backtics:
  <pre>
  &grave;&grave;&grave;
  The backtics MUST be on a line by themselves!
  &grave;&grave;&grave;
  </pre>
- These same backtick tricks also work on **Github** and **Slack**.
- `@here`: Sends a message to everyone currently online in a Slack room
